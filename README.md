# Machine-Learning-Project
Machine Learning Project
Overview
This project is a comprehensive machine learning workflow that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation. It aims to demonstrate best practices in building a machine learning pipeline using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the dataset through statistical summaries and plots.
Model Training: Implementing and training multiple machine learning models to solve the problem.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.8+
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)

Install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
The project uses a dataset stored in the data/ directory (not included in the repository). Ensure you place the dataset file in the appropriate folder or update the file paths in the code. The dataset should be in CSV format and contain the features and target variable for the machine learning task.
