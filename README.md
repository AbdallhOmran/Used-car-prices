# Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project is focused on implementing and experimenting with machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. The goal is to explore data, build models, and evaluate their performance.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Deployment-ready code

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbdallhOmran/Machine-Learning-Project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Machine-Learning-Project
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
3. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
